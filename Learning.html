    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <h2>Dec. 07 2019</h2>
    <p>I am currently taking "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course taught by Colt Steele on Udemy.</p>
    <p>I am halfway through the course. It covers the basics of HTML and CSS. My current progress on the course is 23%. We are going over Bootstrap 4.</p>
    <p>We have mostly gone over front-end stuff. There's a lot to learn, but I find that I am not very fond of front-end development. I prefer back-end development, since I like working with algorithms and date more than I like the visual aspects of Web Development. I can't wait to get to the back-end material of the course...</p>
