            <p>I just added a Bootstrap4 directory in my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/moranjay/Learning">Learning repo</a> on GitHub.</p>
            <p>I'm still going over "The Web Development Bootcamp" course. I didn't know much about Bootstrap before now. But now I feel I have a good grasp of what the possibilities are. This site itself is being developed alongside my learning in this course.</p>
            <p>I'll post my progress from time to time here. I might also post certain insights I gathered from practicing Web Development.</p>
            <p>Here is one example. It's more of a rookie mistake than an insight. I spent a good 5 to 10 minutes trying to figure out why the pattern.css file I added was not loading on the browser. It was getting frustrating, then I realized I was loading the wrong html file. I copied the Starter folder from another directory. I was not browsing the right file. Funny, but it goes to show, there's nothing like actual experience when it comes to software development.</p>
            <p>This site does not look that good yet. I'll try to make it look better over time.</p>

            <p>I am currently taking "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course taught by Colt Steele on Udemy.</p>
            <p>I am halfway through the course. It covers the basics of HTML and CSS. My current progress on the course is 23%. We are going over Bootstrap 4.</p>
            <p>We have mostly gone over front-end stuff. There's a lot to learn, but I find that I am not very fond of front-end development. I prefer back-end development, since I like working with algorithms and data more than I like the visual aspects of Web Development. I can't wait to get to the back-end material of the course...</p>
